define essential & fundamental matrices
 - Essential matrix maps a vector from a principal point to image plane (p1) to the normal of that plane. Sooooo if it's true that Ep1 = normal, then taking a vector in the same epipolar plane and multiplying it with a normal should give zero => p2'Ep1 = p2'n. Beautiful;
 - Fundamental matrix is equivalent but operates on 3D points instead of 2D vectors. Basically replacing the 2d points in the p2'Ep1 by their derivation from projection equation. p = K^(-1)q and this gives F = K2^(-T) E K1^(-1). And the normal mapping is q2'Fq1 = 0. Wonderful;
 - Both of them form requirements for pixel correspondences : )
